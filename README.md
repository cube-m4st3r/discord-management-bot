# Discord-Management-Bot
This is a Management Discord Bot, created for my current Studies and Class. 
It uses Python, FFMPEG and other utilites. 
Primarily used for the Class Discord Server.

## What are my goals with this Project?
Ultimately, I want to create a system that works for me and my classmates.
As I am currently studying Mechnical Engineering in Germany.

I do this as a hobby!

## What are my ideas/branches I want to work on?
I plan to also create a website to work with this Bot, to even configure everything outside of my home network.
